# Speed-Typing-Test

Simple typing test program implemented in Python using the tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). The program generates a list of sentences and prompts the user to type each sentence as it appears on the screen. The user's score is determined by the number of correct sentences typed within a specified time period (which is displayed at the end of the test).

When the program starts, the user is presented with a GUI window containing a label, an input box, and two buttons ("Start" and "Stop"). The label displays the prompt for the user to type the sentence. The input box is where the user types their response. The "Start" button starts the test and the "Stop" button ends the test.

Once the user starts the test, the program selects a random sentence from a list of sentences and displays it on the label. The user then types the sentence in the input box and presses the "Enter" key. If the sentence is correct, the program displays a new sentence and increments the user's score. If the sentence is incorrect, the program clears the input box and allows the user to try again. This process repeats until the user clicks the "Stop" button.

When the test ends, the program displays the user's score and the time taken to complete the test. The program also disables the input box and clears the label to indicate that the test has ended. The user can then click the "Start" button to take the test again.
